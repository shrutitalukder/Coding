//Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
//In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

//If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

//Your Task:
//The task is to complete the function convertToWave(), which converts the given array to a wave array.
//NOTE: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.

//Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
//Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

//Constraints:
//1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 106
//0 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤107

//Solution
#include<iostream>
